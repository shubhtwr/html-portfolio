As a result, I've developed a T-shaped knowledge base, giving me a unique perspective on interdisciplinary fields. With a highly creative mindset, I strive to bring innovation and fresh ideas to everything I do.</p>



<p> Coding is my newfound passion. It's something I've been curious about for a while, and I've finally decided to pursue it by taking baby steps. I find the world of programming fascinating, and I'm eager to learn and explore more in this exciting field.</p>
